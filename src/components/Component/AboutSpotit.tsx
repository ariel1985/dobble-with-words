                    RULES:

                    The object of the game is to make matches and score points. Players find the matching symbols between two cards, a match must have the same shape and the same color; only the size may be different.  There are 4 different mini games you can play.

                    Version 1 – The Tower. Shuffle the cards and deal one card face-down to each player. The rest of the cards form the draw pile, which is placed face-up in the center of the table. The object is to collect the most cards.

                    Players simultaneously flip over their cards. They then try to spot the one symbol that appears both on the center card and on their own cards. If they are the first player to do so, they call it out and take the center card and place it face-up on top of their flipped card, building a personal pile. They will now use the top card of their personal pile to match with the new center card. Each time a new center card is revealed, this process is repeated. Play continues until there are no cards remaining in the draw pile.

                    The player with the most cards in their personal pile wins.
